# AI-IMAGE-GENERATION-APP-MERN



MidJourney and DALL-E are taking over social media. Dive into the world of artificial intelligence and build your own version of these tools that can generate everything from memes and art to beautiful UI/UX designs!

Alongside building this application, I also learn how to:

- Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js together form the powerful MERN stack
- Tailwind: The most popular CSS framework nowadays
- [OpenAI's DALL-E model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction): A deep learning model that generates images from text input
- Cloudinary: A cloud-based image storage service
